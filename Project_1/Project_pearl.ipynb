    "Overview\n",
    "Biking is becoming more prevalent as a form of commuting to work, exercise, traveling, and for leisure. In this project, our group explored cities that were considered \"bike-friendly\" based on the Places for Bikes city ratings. Citites were rated on five factors: Ridership, Safety, Network, Acceleration, and Reach. Each factors were scored on a five-point scale and weighted at 20% each.\n",
    "\n",
    "People for Bikes organization defined the five factors as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridership - reflects how many people in the community ride bikes\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety - considers fatalities and injuries of people on bikes as well as those walking and driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network - evaluates the quality of the bike network -- how completely it connects people to each other and local destinations using comfortable route\n",
    "\n",
    "Reach - determines how well a community's low-stress network serves all members of the community\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceleration - assesses how quickly a community is improving its biking infrastructure and how successful its encouragement programs are at getting people to ride\n",
    "\n",
    "Some abbreviations to keep in mind:\n",
