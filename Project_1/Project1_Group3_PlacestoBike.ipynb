    "## Overview\n",
    "Biking is becoming more prevalent as a form of commuting to work, exercise, traveling, and for leisure. In this project, our group explored cities that were considered \"bike-friendly\" based on the <a href=\"https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/methodology/\" target=\"_blank\">Places for Bikes</a> city ratings. Citites were rated on five factors: Ridership, Safety, Network, Acceleration, and Reach. Each factors were scored on a five-point scale and weighted at 20% each.\n",
    "\n",
    "People for Bikes organization defined the five factors as:\n",
    "<p><strong>Ridership</strong> - reflects how many people in the community ride bikes</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Safety</strong> - considers fatalities and injuries of people on bikes as well as those walking and driving.</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Network</strong> - evaluates the quality of the bike network -- how completely it connects people to each other and local destinations using comfortable route</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Reach</strong> - determines how well a community's low-stress network serves all members of the community</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Acceleration</strong> - assesses how quickly a community is improving its biking infrastructure and how successful its encouragement programs are at getting people to ride</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some abbreviations to keep in mind:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>ACS - U.S. Census American Community Survey</li>\n",
    "    <li>FARS - Fatality Analysis Reporting System</li>\n",
    "    <li>BNA - PlacesForBikes Bike Network Analysis</li>\n",
